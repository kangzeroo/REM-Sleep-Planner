# REM Sleep Planner #

## About ##
REM sleep planner helps you calculate how many REM cycles of sleep you will get or need for a certain time. REM cycles are important because they represent the natural cycle of deep sleep a human undergoes, typically equal to 90 minutes. Waking up between REM cycles feels natural, whereas waking in the middle of one feels terrible. It's why 40 minute naps feel worse than 20 minute naps (by 40 mins you are deep in the middle of a cycle, whereas 20 mins you are not deep in).
